********************************************************************************************************************
Directory structure of StressTest is as follow:
********************************************************************************************************************

The current directory contains two sub-directories named, Hierarchical-locks-Graph and Hierarchical-locks-Tree. Hierarchical-locks-Graph contains implementation of directed graph data structure and Hierarchical-locks-Tree contains implementation of binary tree data structure.
We use these two data structure for the evaluation of out Multi-DomLock technique against the standard Intention locking technique for the hierarchies.


The directory Hierarchical-locks-Tree is organized as follow:

1. The directory "src" holds all the source code files. The header file, Tree.h contains the concurrent procedure "DummyTask()" which uses the Multi-DomLock and Intention locks for synchronization. In file "Tree.h", the function  "modifiedDFS()" assigns the interval values to the nodes in the tree.

The directory structure of Hierarchical-locks-Graph is same as the Hierarchical-locks-Tree.
